# 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

```
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
- How Merge Sort works
- The Big O of the best, average, and worst cases for Merge Sort
```

## [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/ronroeandassociates/sorting_algorithms/blob/main/0-O)

slow sorting algorithim for the simple data set

| Case                     | Performance |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Best Case performance    | O(n)        |
| Average Case Performance | O(n^2)      |
| worst case performance   | O(n^2)      |

## [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/ronroeandassociates/sorting_algorithms/blob/main/1-O)

An insertion sort has the benefits of simplicity and low overhead

| Case                     | Performance |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Best Case performance    | O(n)        |
| Average Case Performance | O(n^2)      |
| worst case performance   | O(n^2)      |

## [Selection Sort](https://github.com/ronroeandassociates/sorting_algorithms/blob/main/2-O)

Selection sort is noted for simplicity, has performance advantage over more complicated algorithms in certain situations

| Case                     | Performance |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Best Case performance    | O(n^2)      |
| Average Case Performance | O(n^2)      |
| worst case performance   | O(n^2)      |

## [Quick Sort](https://github.com/ronroeandassociates/sorting_algorithms/blob/main/3-O)

Quick Sort is a recursive sorting algorithm Quick Sort in general does not require extra space.

| Base                     | Performance |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Best Case performance    | O(n^2)      |
| Average Case Performance | O(n log n)  |
| worst case performance   | O(n log n)  |
